stormpath-jersey-sample
====================

This is a sample web application that uses Java + Jersey on the backend and Angular JS on the frontend. It demonstrates how to use the Stormpath Java SDK to generate API Keys, create new accounts, generate Oauth Tokens, and make HTTP calls to REST endpoints using both Oauth and Basic Authentication.

Stormpath is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

**Generate an Oauth Token** <br>
This functionality lets you exchange your API credentials for an Oauth Token. First, select the cities you'd like to be able to have access to (scope). Clicking GetOauth will generate your token and set you up for the next section.

**Make permitted REST call using Oauth** <br>
Since we included San Mateo in our scope when generating an Oauth Token we can view it's weather with no problem.

**Make a forbidden REST call using Oauth** <br>
Since we did not include Berlin in our scope when generating an Oauth Token, attempting to view it's weather is prohibited!
